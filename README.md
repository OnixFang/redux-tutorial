# redux-tutorial

This project is based on the [Redux tutorial by Mosh Hamedani:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQXNp9ItL4). But this YouTube video just stops as a web console app. So I learned how to connect react with redux, with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY).

After finishing the second tutorial, I went on to create the react app for the first tutorial on my own to test my skills!
